## Example Site With Integrated Blog Component

This repo has two branches

- master - The starter files
- final - The finished example

To follow along with my blog post, just clone this repo and you're good to go.

If you want to see the finished product, clone this repo and
checkout the final branch

    git checkout origin final
    npm run setup
    npm start

Thanks!
